I am a Machine Learning Engineer at Apple knowledge platform team. Prior to this, I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Notre Dame. I am passionate about building ML solutions to solve real-world problems. In particular, I am interested in developing machine learning models for mining complex large-scale knowledge graphs.
